Brief Introduction for Beauty Store Local NZ
This Full-Stack project is an E-Commerce platform for beauty products. It is designed to replicate the functions of a typical beauty store, allowing users to view products, place orders, check out, and view their purchased orders. The inspiration for this project came from my desire to design my own store and visualize what it might look like.

Users can navigate to the catalog page to view beauty products and select items to add to their carts, specifying the desired quantity. Once they have finished choosing their items, they can review their cart to see what they have selected and decide if they want to remove any items. When satisfied, users can log in or register, and proceed to checkout. After filling out their details, they will receive an order confirmation and can view their current or previous orders.

One thing I am proud of is the checkout process that follows the traditional process, customer details, payment, view, and then confirm.


Basic and Advanced features
- Guests or Members can add or remove products from their cart and update the cost automatically
- Guests can register or log in to an existing account to place an order and view their past orders
- A search and filter option designed to help users find what they're looking for without having to scroll for it
- Once members checkout then an order is placed and logged into their own orders
- Members who are signed in, items placed inside their carts are remembered even when logged out.
