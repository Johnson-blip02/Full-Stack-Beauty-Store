Brief Introduction for Beauty Store Local NZ
This Full-Stack project is based on E-Commerce stores for Beauty products. This project is designed to mimic the functions of a normal beauty store, with the ability to view, order, check out, and view purchased orders. The inspiration came from always wanting to design my store and imagine what it would look like. 

One thing I am proud of is the checkout process that follows the traditional process, customer details, payment, view, and then confirm.


Basic and Advanced features
- Guests or Members can add or remove products from their cart and update the cost automatically
- Guests can register or log in to an existing account to place an order and view their past orders
- A search and filter option designed to help users find what they're looking for without having to scroll for it
- Once members checkout then an order is placed and logged into their own orders
- Members who are signed in, items placed inside their carts are remembered even when logged out.
